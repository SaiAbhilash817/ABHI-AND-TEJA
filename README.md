## Project Overview

Startup founders in India often face challenges in accessing reliable funding information due to fragmented data sources, language limitations, and the lack of transparent AI-based tools. Critical information related to investors, funding trends, and government schemes is primarily available in English and spread across multiple documents and platforms.

This project presents a **Multilingual Startup Funding Intelligence System** powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The system enables founders to ask funding-related questions in Indic languages and receive accurate, source-backed, and easy-to-understand insights generated strictly from verified funding data.

## Problem Statement

- Funding information is scattered across reports, PDFs, and web portals  
- Most platforms are English-centric, limiting accessibility  
- Traditional search tools lack contextual understanding  
- Generic AI chatbots provide unverifiable or hallucinated responses  

---

## Solution Approach

The system aggregates structured and unstructured startup funding data into a unified knowledge base. When a user submits a query, relevant information is retrieved and passed to a generative AI model through a RAG pipeline to produce reliable and explainable answers. Multilingual language processing ensures inclusivity for regional founders.

---

## Key Differentiators

- Indic-language support as a core design feature  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation for factual accuracy  
- Source-grounded and explainable AI responses  
- Startup funding–focused intelligence rather than generic search  
- Scalable, API-based architecture  

---

## Features

- Multilingual query and response support  
- RAG-based retrieval with document grounding  
- Hybrid search using semantic and keyword techniques  
- Actionable insights on investors, schemes, and funding stages  
- Reduced hallucinations through retrieval-first generation  
- Modular and extensible system design  

---

## System Workflow

1. User submits a funding-related query  
2. Language detection and normalization  
3. Query embedding generation  
4. Relevant document retrieval  
5. RAG orchestration and validation  
6. Grounded response generation  
7. Multilingual response delivery
